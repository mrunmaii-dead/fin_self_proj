# Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting

This project involves analyzing historical financial data from major stocks to uncover key market trends, assess portfolio risks, and forecast future price movements using time series models.

## Project Overview

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed stock market data to identify key patterns, price trends, and correlations between assets.
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluated portfolio-level risk and volatility to support informed investment decisions.
- **Forecasting Models:**
  - **ARIMA:** Built classical time series models for short-term prediction.
  - **LSTM:** Developed deep learning models using TensorFlow to capture long-term dependencies and nonlinear trends.
- **Model Performance:** Achieved forecasting accuracy of up to **85%**, aiding strategic financial decision-making.

## Files Included

- **`StockAna2.ipynb`**  
  Contains the core data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and initial modeling attempts using traditional methods.

- **`StockAna.ipynb`**  
  Developed in Google Colab with GPU support, this notebook implements advanced deep learning models using **TensorFlow**, especially LSTM networks, for forecasting stock prices.
